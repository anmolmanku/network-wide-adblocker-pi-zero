# 🛡️ Network-Wide Adblocker (Pi-hole)

### **Role:** Network Administration (Self-Hosted)

---

## 🚀 Overview
Standard ISP routers lack granular traffic control and expose networks to telemetry and intrusive advertising. This project implements a **network-wide DNS sinkhole** to reduce bandwidth usage, block telemetry, and enforce network-level security policies without requiring client-side software.

* **Networking:** DNS, DHCP, SSH
* **Storage:** 64GB MicroSD

## ⚙️ How It Works
The Pi-hole acts as a gatekeeper for DNS requests. Instead of devices connecting directly to the open internet for ads, the traffic follows this logic:

1.  **Request:** Client device asks for `ads.google.com`.
2.  **Forward:** Router sends the query to the Raspberry Pi.
3.  **Sinkhole:** Pi-hole compares the request against a massive "Gravity" database.
4.  **Result:** * **Blocked:** The Pi returns `0.0.0.0` (the ad never loads).
    * **Allowed:** The Pi returns the real IP and the content loads.

## ✨ Key Features & Benefits
* **Privacy by Default:** Blocks tracking and telemetry at the source.
* **Network Performance:** Saves bandwidth by preventing ad-heavy assets from downloading.
* **Device Agnostic:** Protects everything from Smart TVs and IoT devices to mobile phones without installing individual apps.
